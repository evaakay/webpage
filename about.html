  		<h2>My name is EVA and I'm so thrilled to meet you!</h2>
  		<p>
<!--   		I love to travel with my camera to places where I&#39ve never been, admire architecture and enjoy local food (and wine). Our world is full of beautiful places and I would love to see as much of it as possible. I love the moments that take my breath away. I am hungry for knowledge and experiences. I always immerse myself in my work until it&#39s all done &#0150 which turns out to be equally good and bad thing. I suffer from severe &quotfear of missing out&quot and so I always try to squeeze the maximum into each day of my life. -->
		Since I was little, I&#39ve loved to draw. Drawing and sketching can keep me busy for hours. When I travel I always bring my sketchbook. I love to visit places where I&#39ve never been, sketch local architecture and enjoy local food (and wine). </br>
  		I often found myself helping my friends with creating logos, brands, tshirt designs and eventually desigining apps and websites. I really enjoy being part of the creative process and creating something people identify with and love. When I am not woring on any design projects, I am probably traveling or spending my time outdoors. Lately I&#39ve been obsessed by racing triathlons and backpacking.
		<br><br>
		As for my profession, I am an architect in Washington, DC and just like many of my peers I&#39ve chosen architecture for the lovely balance of creativity and technical understanding. I&#39ve always wanted to create and design as well as to figure out how stuff works!
		<br><br>
		Now let's hear about you! I would love to learn about your projects and help to develop the perfect design for you!
