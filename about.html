  		<h2>My name is EVA and I'm so thrilled to meet you!</h2>
  		<p>
  		I love to travel with my camera to places where I&#39ve never been, admire architecture and enjoy local food (and wine). Our world is full of beautiful places and I would love to see as much of it as possible. I love the moments that take my breath away. I am hungry for knowledge and experiences. I always immerse myself in my work until it&#39s all done &#0150 which turns out to be equally good and bad thing. I suffer from severe &quotfear of missing out&quot and so I always try to squeeze the maximum into each day of my life.

		<br><br>As for my profession, I am an architect in Washington, DC and just like many of my peers I&#39ve chosen architecture for the lovely balance of creativity and technical understanding. I&#39ve always wanted to create and design as well as to figure out how stuff works!

  		<br><br>Since I was little, I&#39ve loved to draw. Drawing and sketching can keep me busy for hours. When my friends needed aesthetic opinion or a new logo they would often ask for my help. So somewhat naturally, I found myself working on projects for my friends, honing my graphic design skills and enjoying every second of it. If I am not designing you will find me outdoors, probably exploring some mountains or racing triathlons.
		<br><br>
  		Now, let&#39s hear about you and what you are up to! I would love to learn about your ideas and hopefully collaborate with you to create something awesome! Drop me a line!</p>
