  		<p>
<!--   		I love to travel with my camera to places where I&#39ve never been, admire architecture and enjoy local food (and wine). Our world is full of beautiful places and I would love to see as much of it as possible. I love the moments that take my breath away. I am hungry for knowledge and experiences. I always immerse myself in my work until it&#39s all done &#0150 which turns out to be equally good and bad thing. I suffer from severe &quotfear of missing out&quot and so I always try to squeeze the maximum into each day of my life. Since I enjoy learning and creating, I learned HTML and CSS programming languages to built this website from scratch.-->
		My name is Eva Kodouskova /Eva Kay for short/ and I was that kid that was always drawing. 
		</br></br>
  		For as long as I remember, my friends would ask me for a help with various design projects. Over the time I've created sweet designs I'm truly proud of and decided to share some of them with the world. I love the creative process and designing something people love and use. 
  		<br/><br/>
  		When I travel I always bring my sketchbook. I love to visit new places and sketch the architecture while having a glass of wine. 
		<br><br>
		As for my profession, I am an architect in Washington, DC and just like many of my peers I&#39ve chosen architecture for the lovely balance of creativity and technical understanding. 
		<br><br>
		I hope this page brings you joy and inspiration.
		<br>
		Yours truly,
	</p>
